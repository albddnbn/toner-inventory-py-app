# toner-inventory-py-app
An app built using Python 3 and PyQt5 that helps for the intake and maintenance of printer/toner related inventory in a business setting, like a college.

To build this, I did use some other code, most of which I found here on Github. Thank you!

Credits:

Powershell script to help set up the app: jstack03 (PrinterInventoryInstall directory / PrinterInventoryInstall.ps1 script)

LED Indicator widgets (red and green) on the barcode scan window: https://github.com/nlamprian/pyqt5-led-indicator-widget
  - changed this a bit to fit into the app
